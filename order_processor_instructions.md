# Ruby Developer - Technical Exercise

**Duration:** 60 minutes

---

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Ruby 2.7+

**To run:**
```bash
ruby order_processor_test.rb
```

---

## Exercise

### Phase 1: Debug
Run the test suite. One test is failing. Fix the bug.

### Phase 2: Optimize
The performance test is too slow. Optimize the code to run faster.

### Phase 3: Refactor
Refactor the `OrderProcessor` class to improve design and readability. Tests must still pass.

### Phase 4: Closing thoughts (10 minutes at the end)
Reflect on what has been done.

## AI usage

Given that this is mostly a review / refactor exercise, we don't expect you to use an AI tool to complete the review/refactor. However, if you'd like to use AI in place of google (for example to look at how a certain method works), please do while sharing your screen. Same goes for google.
